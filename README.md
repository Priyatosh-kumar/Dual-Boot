| **Will I lose my Windows files when I install Linux?** | No. If you choose the option to install Linux alongside Windows, your files and Windows system will stay safe.                                       |
| **Do I need to backup my data before starting?**        | Yes, it‚Äôs always safest to back up important files before changing your system, just in case something goes wrong.                                  |

| **How much space should I give to Linux?**                | At least 20 GB is recommended for Linux to run smoothly, but more space is better if you plan to install many apps or store files.                   |
| **What if my computer doesn‚Äôt boot from USB?**            | Check your BIOS settings to make sure USB boot is enabled, or try pressing a different key (like F12, Esc, F2 or *depending on your computer's manufacturer*) to open the boot menu.              |
| **Is it okay if I don‚Äôt disable BitLocker or Secure Boot?** | It might cause installation problems or prevent Linux from booting. Disabling them as described helps ensure smooth installation and operation.       |
